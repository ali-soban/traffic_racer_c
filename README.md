# traffic_racer_c
 This was a group project for our Programming Fundamentals course in 1st semester. We decided to go for a game, and using only C language, we were able to create a game very similar to classic mobile game of Traffic Racer, where we have a top-down view of the car, and incoming objects with varying speed which need to be avoided by moving the car.
